- 👋 Hi, I’m @GKM20220828
- 👀 I’m a research worker in a pharmaceutical in Japan, and faced to use a legacy equipment for my research work.
-     This equipment is controlled with a certain program which move on Windows XP, and manufacturer's support is no more available.
-     Now,I'm thinking about to order a new program, or to write down just simple program with Excel VBA by myself.
-     If I decide to write my own program, I think I need to learn about serial communication in Excel VBA. 
-     I've ever collected data from experimental equipments by means of homemade BASIC program using RS232C more than 30 years ago.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Excel VBA, python, linux a little. I love Lab-view.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on larning the basic of VBA, especially the serial communication,but after it is successfully installed to my projekt.
- 📫 How to reach me ...Im going to up my e-mail address when I stuck in writing program, or success to install it.
